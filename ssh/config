# Main SSH config file
#
# This file has the basic config options for SSH.
#
# If you want to add more concrete options for different
# SSH connections it is better if you add a different
# config file in ~/.ssh/ with the extension .conf. That new
# file will be loaded automatically by this main config file.
#
# Example:
#
#   % cat ~/.ssh/work.conf
#   Host work
#     HostName working.com
#     User me
#
#   % ssh work # will log as me@working.com

# If there is an ssh-agent running,
# make sure the key is added to it
AddKeysToAgent yes

# Load custom config files ending by .conf
Include *.conf

# vim:set ft=sshconfig:
